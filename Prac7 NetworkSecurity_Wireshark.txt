6)select tcp packet and click on ok
7)find ip address of machine with ipconfig command
 IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.78.1
8)Make use of any other machine in network with the current machine. Either a LAN connection or wireless connection.
Here, as we are in wireless connection with mobile. We get the ip address of mobile. Else the ip address of machine with ehich this computer is in LAN is taken.
For mobile , Go to setting -> ipaddress or setting – status
information-> ip address.
9)keep source adress as u r pic ip address and keep destination as u r mobile ip adress
10)Now add one more ARP packet. Click on Add

continue.(i choose microsoft)
16)Select Burts mode and loop sending. Give loops as 1000 and dalay between loops as 0.1 milisecond.
17)start
18)stop wireshark capturing.
Filter used: ip.addr == 192.168.76.104 && ip.addr == 192.0.0.2
19)Output:Apply filter.
Comment: Here we can see the packets exchanged between
the source ip address i.e. out machine’s ip address and the
destination ip address i.e. the LAN or wireless network
machine.
